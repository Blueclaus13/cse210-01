Dice is played according to the following rules.

    #  The game is played with five dice.
    #  The player is asked, "Roll dice?" at the beginning of each turn.
    #  If the player answers "n" or no, the game is over.
    #  If the player answers "y" or yes, the points are added to their score.
    #  The player scores 100 points for each one that is rolled.
    #  The player scores 50 points for each five that is rolled.
    #  The dice values and player score are displayed on the screen.
    #  If the player does not roll any ones or fives the game is over.
